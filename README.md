# Hotel Reservations Prediction

This project aims to predict hotel reservation statuses—whether a booking will be honored or canceled—using machine learning techniques.
By analyzing historical booking data, the model helps hotels optimize resource allocation, reduce revenue loss, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

The hospitality industry often faces challenges due to booking cancellations, leading to revenue losses and operational inefficiencies.
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a reservation being canceled.
Such predictions enable proactive measures, like overbooking strategies or targeted customer communications, to mitigate potential losses.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Hotel Booking Demand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) from Kaggle.
This dataset includes various features such as:

- Booking details (e.g., lead time, arrival date)
- Customer demographics (e.g., country, market segment)
- Reservation specifics (e.g., room type, deposit type)
- Special requests and previous cancellations

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development
- `src/` - Source code modules for data processing and model training
- `pipeline/` - Scripts for building and evaluating the ML pipeline
- `utils/` - Utility functions for data handling and preprocessing
- `templates/` & `static/` - Files for the web application's frontend
- `app.py` - Flask application for deploying the prediction model
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python packages
- `setup.py` - Script for installing the package

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShahhNasir/Hotel-Reservations-Prediction.git
   cd Hotel-Reservations-Prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Train the model:**

   Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to preprocess data and train the model.

2. **Run the web application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Access the application by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

## Results

The machine learning model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy:** *e.g., 85%*
- **Precision:** *e.g., 80%*
- **Recall:** *e.g., 78%*
- **F1-Score:** *e.g., 79%*

*Note: Replace the above metrics with your actual results after evaluation.*
